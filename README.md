## Course-Stack
`CourseStack` is a web application that acts as a single platform for students and professionals to explore and learn courses of their interest. 

#### Click on the link provided to view the web application live [CourseStack](https://parithoshpoojary.github.io/course-stack/course-stack/).

## Getting Started

* **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/parithoshpoojary/course-stack.git`
* **Change your dir to:** `cd course-stack/`

###### This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start the application, follow the instructions below.

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed globally. I used `npm` package manager to manage all the dependencies. To install npm [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**Change your dir to:** `cd course-stack/src/`.

After installing the `npm`, run `npm install` on the commnad prompt to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute or so).

### Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the Project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
